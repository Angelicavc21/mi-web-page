      <h3>What We do</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">This website is dedicated precisely to those women of the world who have a great desire and are paralyzed by fear.
         Fear of leaving everything behind - even if it is not for a short period of time - fear of not knowing how to get out of their safe area,
          fear of being alone, fear of having a bad time, fear of being lost, fear of not being found, fear of the people, fear of the different thing, 
          fear to that it does not find food "like in house".
          
      </p>
      <p class="text">
          Because traveling gives you wings, gives you freedom, gives you energy,
          fills you with new ideas and encourages imagination,
          diversifies the perspective with which you usually look
           at your world and opens new doors for you. 
          Because traveling is learning and making mistakes - and vice versa. 
          Traveling frees you from ties: physical, mental, ideological, spiritual, religious, political and social.
